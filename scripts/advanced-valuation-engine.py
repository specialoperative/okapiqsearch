Perfect — that’s a killer differentiator to layer on top of the TAM/TSM engine 🚀. Right now, every tool out there (CapIQ, Grata, brokers) stops at structured data. They don’t give you the “scrappy intelligence” that junior analysts and interns are forced to chase down. If Okapiq offers both quantitative auto-market maps + qualitative scrappy intel, we leapfrog everyone.

⚡ Adding “Scrappy Intelligence Gathering” to Okapiq
1. What It Means

Human-style probing: “What’s the demand for dental practices in Plano, TX?”

Scrapes, forums, LinkedIn groups, Chamber of Commerce directories.

Local insights: sponsorships, hiring boards, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist ads.

Intern-like queries, automated by prompts + lightweight scraping.

➡ Analysts already do this manually — Okapiq makes it a feature.

2. How We Build It

OpenAI layer → converts questions into structured search queries.

SerpAPI / Apify / Google Custom Search → pull blogs, directories, local news.

Lightweight scrapers → Craigslist, Indeed, FB Marketplace, niche boards.

Review NLP → cluster reviews into “what customers care about” buckets (speed, quality, price).

Intern mode toggle → outputs a “scrappy market memo” alongside TAM/TSM.

3. Examples

📌 User Query: “What’s the pool cleaning scene in Scottsdale, AZ?”
Okapiq Output:

TAM: $280M (pool services in AZ)

TSM: $35M (Scottsdale metro, households >$90k income)

Fragmentation: 0.19 (very fragmented)

Scrappy Insights:

Craigslist: 42 independent pool cleaners posting ads weekly.

Yelp: avg review volume growing 12% YoY.

Facebook Groups: 3k-member “Scottsdale Pool Owners” group with recurring “need a guy” posts.

Local news: drought-related pool regulation debates → regulatory risk flagged.

📌 Query: “Are there landscaping roll-up opportunities in Orlando?”
Output includes:

TAM/TSM + fragmentation.

Scrappy:

Local HOAs hiring posts on Indeed.

FB group chatter about lawncare pricing hikes.

Google Trends: “lawn mowing service near me” up 19% YoY.

78% of firms don’t have websites.

4. How to Pitch This

To searchers: You don’t need 3 interns googling local plumbers — Okapiq is your intern.

To junior analysts: Save 30+ hours of legwork per memo.

To brokers: Positioning deals with local “color” makes CIMs 10x more persuasive.

To LPs/ICs: Qualitative + quantitative = conviction.

5. Positioning

Okapiq = Structured Market Maps + Scrappy Ground Intelligence
No one else delivers both.

Bloomberg Terminal tells you “the market cap.”
Okapiq tells you “here are 40 pool guys posting ads on Craigslist this week.”

👉 Do you want me to fold this into the Okapiq architecture doc (so “Intern Mode” is its own API/feature), or draft a pitch one-pager explaining scrappy intelligence as the differentiator to LPs/clients?

create this all we want to make an all in one smb market intelligence platform with okapiq
ChatGPT said:

🔥 Got it — let’s blueprint Okapiq as the all-in-one SMB Market Intelligence Platform. Think Bloomberg Terminal for Main Street, but with TAM/TSM math, fragmentation, deal scoring, AND scrappy intern-style intel all tied together.

🏗 Okapiq Architecture (All-in-One SMB Market Intelligence)
1. Data Layer (APIs + Scrappy Sources)

Google Maps API → business listings, hours, categories, reviews.

Yelp API → reviews, ratings, competitor density.

Data Axle API → NAICS codes, revenue/employee ranges, ownership data.

US Census API → demographics, income, business dynamics.

ArcGIS API → geographic overlays, household wealth, density maps.

SerpAPI → search trends, competitor ads, keyword demand.

Apify Scrapers → Craigslist, Indeed, Facebook groups, LinkedIn job posts.

OpenAI Layer → NLP for review clustering, scrappy text analysis, categorization.

📌 Unique Okapiq Add-On: Scrappy Intelligence Mode that searches forums, job boards, and local chatter — simulating what a team of interns would do.

2. Intelligence Engine (Core Calculators)

Each module outputs numbers + plain-English insights.

Valuation Engine

Review → Customers → Revenue → Multiples.

Diagnostics for every factor (digital presence, demographics, sentiment).

TAM (Total Addressable Market)

TAM = (# of businesses in category & region) × (avg revenue per business)


TSM (Total Serviceable Market)

TSM = TAM × Service Area Fit × Buyer Persona Fit


Fragmentation Index

Herfindahl–Hirschman Index from Yelp/Google competitor counts.

“High fragmentation = roll-up opportunity.”

Succession Risk Score

Based on company age (from Data Axle, SOS filings).

Demographics by ZIP (census median age vs industry norms).

Sole proprietorship proxies.

Digital Presence Score

Website status, reviews per customer, social media mentions.

“Low score = modernization upside.”

Ad Spend & Arbitrage Calculator

Uses SERP/Google Ads keyword volume × CPC.

Shows cost per lead vs revenue per lead.

Flags gaps → “$200 CPL vs $900 customer value = arbitrage.”

Scrappy Market Intel (Intern Mode)

Craigslist: # of service providers posting.

Indeed: # of job listings by category.

FB/Reddit chatter: customer pain points.

Google Trends: demand signals.

3. Output Layer (Client Deliverables)

Analyst Dashboards

TAM/TSM with maps.

Fragmentation heatmap.

Succession + digital weakness radar.

Competitor benchmark table.

Auto-Generated IC Memo (Export to PDF/Word)
Sections:

Executive Summary

TAM/TSM sizing

Fragmentation analysis

Competitive landscape

Succession + digital adoption risks

Investment insights & recommended targets

Scrappy Add-Ons

“Local Market Pulse” section with intern-style findings.

Eg: “Scottsdale Pool Cleaning → 42 Craigslist postings/week, drought regulation chatter in AZ news, 3k-member FB group with recurring demand.”

4. Frontend Experience (for Searchers & Analysts)

Search bar: enter company name / industry / geography.

Dashboard auto-populates:

TAM, TSM, Fragmentation, Succession, Digital Weakness, Arbitrage.

Toggle Intern Mode → shows scrappy intel.

Save company to pipeline → side-by-side compare.

One-click export → “IC memo” ready for LPs or partners.

5. Target ICPs & Why This Beats Everyone Else

Searchfund Entrepreneurs (ETA Searchers) → don’t need interns; Okapiq finds roll-up opportunities + writes memos.

Junior PE Analysts → saves 40 hours per memo, looks sharp to partners.

Brokers → market intel + scrappy data makes CIMs persuasive.

LPs/Investors → conviction comes from numbers + local color.

🚀 Differentiator

Other tools stop at structured databases (CapIQ, Grata, Data Axle).
Okapiq uniquely combines:

Quant Market Maps (TAM/TSM, fragmentation, valuation)

Qual Scrappy Intel (forums, job boards, ads, customer chatter)

Narrative Outputs (auto IC memos + dashboards)

👉 “It’s like Bloomberg Terminal + Intern Army for SMBs.”

✅ Next Step:
I can draft the full system code skeleton (backend + frontend hooks + API modules) or make a deck/one-pager pitch that shows Okapiq as the all-in-one SMB intelligence tool for searchers & PE.

Do you want me to (a) start writing the unified code skeleton for Okapiq (Python/TypeScript + API integrations), or (b) draft the polished pitch deck content so you can sell this vision first?

pre and end markets
ChatGPT said:

Good Q — thinking in pre- and end-markets is exactly how the best PE analysts frame SMB intel. Let me break it down in the Okapiq context 👇

🏭 Pre-Markets vs End-Markets in SMB Intelligence
1. Pre-Markets (Inputs / Supply-Side Ecosystem)

This is everything before the business serves the end customer:

Suppliers / Vendors

Where do inputs come from? (e.g., dental suppliers, HVAC distributors, food wholesalers).

Labor Market

Hiring costs, job postings (Indeed, Craigslist, FB Jobs).

Demographic availability (Census: % of working-age population, trade licenses).

Regulatory Environment

Licensing boards (state-level databases).

OSHA / compliance costs.

Capital Environment

Lending rates for SMBs, SBA loan density by region.

👉 In Okapiq, this shows up as: input costs, labor pressure, supply-side fragility.
E.g.: “50% of landscapers in Phoenix report seasonal labor shortages; supplier concentration risk (3 distributors control 70% of irrigation equipment).”

2. End-Markets (Outputs / Demand-Side Ecosystem)

This is everything about who buys and why they buy:

Customer Segments

B2C vs B2B split.

Household income & age by ZIP (Census + ArcGIS).

Industry demand clusters (NAICS + Data Axle).

Channel Access

Digital presence (websites, Google Business, Yelp).

Paid ad efficiency (SERP API → CPCs vs conversion value).

Macro Drivers

Demographic tailwinds (aging population = more dental, home care).

Regulatory tailwinds (e.g., state-mandated security in schools).

Competitive Substitutes

How fragmented is the local end-market?

HHI index from Yelp/Google data.

👉 In Okapiq, this shows up as: TSM, fragmentation, digital penetration, customer demand curves.
E.g.: “Palm Beach has $310M TSM for accounting, but only 29% of firms have websites → strong end-market demand, weak supply-side digital access.”

3. Why This Matters for Investors/Searchers

Pre-Market Strength → tells you how stable operations are (labor, suppliers, regulation).

End-Market Opportunity → tells you how much demand + arbitrage potential exists.

The Sweet Spot → industries with weak end-market competition and fragmented pre-markets (lots of small suppliers/vendors) = best roll-up opportunities.

📊 Example (Security Guard Firms – Texas)

Pre-Market

Labor: 22,000 licensed guards; wages growing 6% YoY.

Regulation: Texas DPS licenses create moderate barriers.

Supplier: Uniform/equipment largely commoditized → low supplier power.

End-Market

TAM: $4.8B (2,300 firms × $2.1M avg revenue).

TSM (Houston + Dallas): $1.7B demand.

End-Customer: 80% contracts from commercial & municipal buyers.

Fragmentation: 77% of firms <50 employees.

👉 Takeaway: Strong labor/regulatory moat + fragmented end-market = great roll-up candidate.

⚡ If we wire this into Okapiq, each company’s dashboard could show Pre-Market Score + End-Market Score, then an Opportunity Heatmap.

E.g.:

Pre-Market Score: 62/100 (tight labor, moderate regulatory).

End-Market Score: 88/100 (fragmented, high demand).

🔥 Overall: “High demand, fragmented → roll-up attractive.”

Do you want me to design the Pre-Market / End-Market scoring model (weighted factors, formulas, API data sources), so every business in Okapiq gets both scores → then tie them into TAM/TSM + Valuation?

Okapiq Architecture And Code V1
Okapiq — UX, Visuals, Algorithms & Reference Code (V1)

This blueprint turns Okapiq into the best-in-class SMB market intelligence platform. It covers user questions, visualizations, interaction patterns, scoring formulas, and reference TypeScript code (backend + frontend).

1) Core User Questions (by ICP)
A. Searchers (ETA)

Where should I buy? (top ZIPs/metros by opportunity)

Who are the 10 best targets this month? Why?

What’s the upside? (ad arbitrage, digital uplift, cross-sell)

What risks are hidden? (succession, customer concentration, regulation)

B. Junior PE Analysts

Size the market (TAM/TSM) and structure (fragmentation/HHI)

Benchmarks: revenue/employee, review velocity, pricing

Roll-up logic: how many tuck-ins to reach $X EBITDA?

Confidence: which inputs drive valuation? (diagnostics)

C. Brokers / Sell-Side

Comps by radius/region

Narrative proof: demand signals + local color (scrappy intel)

Justify price: show TAM/TSM + scarcity + stickiness

2) Visualization System (Analyst-First, Investor-Friendly)

All charts support hover tooltips with formula + source; click = drilldown; right pane = narrative “Why this matters.”

TAM/TSM Waterfall

Bars: Total Industry → Geo Filter → Service Radius → ICP Filters → TSM.

Shows % retained at each stage, with absolute $.

Fragmentation & HHI

Bar chart of top N firms by est. share; HHI gauge; note on DOJ thresholds.

Pre vs End-Market Radar

Radar chart of Pre-Market (labor tightness, supplier power, regulation) vs End-Market (demand density, fragmentation, digital penetration).

Succession Heatmap

Choropleth by ZIP: weighted owner-age proxy × business-age × sole-proprietor density.

Digital Presence Quadrant

X: SEO/visibility; Y: Conversion UX; size: review velocity; color: CPC pressure.

Ad Arbitrage Curve

Spend vs. CPL/CPA and ROAS; breakeven and saturation points.

Review Velocity Sparkline + Confidence Band

12–24 months review counts; shaded band = CI; dots = anomalies.

Competitor Constellation Map

Geo scatter with cluster lens; lasso-select to compare.

Deal Economics Simulator

Sliders: price, debt rate, multiple, synergy; outputs: DSCR, IRR, payback.

3) Interaction Patterns (UX)

Compare Mode: pin 2–4 markets or targets; synced crosshair on all charts.

Scenario Sliders: review→customer rate, CAC, ticket size, operating multiple.

Explainability: every KPI has a (i) popover with formula + sources + last-refresh.

Confidence Badges: Low/Med/High based on data freshness/coverage by source.

Intern Mode: a right-rail card with scrappy intel (jobs posts, forum chatter, Craigslist volume, FB groups), with links.

One-Click Memo: assemble selected visuals + narrative into PDF.

4) Algorithms (Formulas + Weights)

[... section unchanged ...]

7) Frontend Reference (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
7.1 Store (/frontend/src/store.ts)
import create from 'zustand';
import { BusinessInput, ValuationResult } from '../../shared/types/business';


type State = {
  input: Partial<BusinessInput>;
  result?: ValuationResult;

      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(input)
    });
    const data = await res.json();
    setResult(data);
  }


  return (
    <div className="p-4 grid gap-2">
      <input

  );
}

✅ With this blueprint, Okapiq delivers:

Analyst-level TAM/TSM, fragmentation, succession, digital, arbitrage.

Interactive dashboards for searchers & PE analysts.

Auto IC memos via export.

Strong backend formulas + explainability.

Next step: wire in real API connectors (Yelp, Data Axle, Census, SERP, ArcGIS) in the enrichment services, and expand the visualization layer with chart libs (Recharts, D3).

Done. I added a full ICP playbook (self-funded searchers vs. independent sponsors) into your canvas:

Profiles, goals, constraints, buying triggers

Must-have features and default dashboards

KPIs, onboarding, pricing, messaging, objections, ROI

Sales demo flows, presets (JSON you can load at signup), and outbound email templates

Engineering flags so the app toggles UI/weights per ICP

Want me to wire the presets into the backend so /api/preset/:icp bootstraps a project with defaults and demo data?

You said:
now what will brokers look for any one looking for propeotary deal sourcing
ChatGPT said:

Great question — brokers are a different but super high-value ICP, especially if you want to win proprietary deal sourcing.

Here’s what brokers, M&A advisors, and boutique bankers look for (and how Okapiq can deliver it):

🔍 Broker ICP: What They Care About

Deal Flow Visibility

Who are the likely buyers in a geography/sector?

Which roll-up groups or funds are active right now?

What multiples are being paid in comparable deals?

Proprietary Signal Discovery

Small companies that aren’t yet on Axial / BizBuySell.

“Hidden sellers” → aging owners, succession risk, no website, low digital presence.

Signs of distress (review decline, shrinking headcount, lien filings).

Packaging Deals

How do I make my sell-side CIM look more attractive?

TAM/TSM visuals, fragmentation maps, demographic overlays for buyer decks.

Efficiency

Time is money: brokers don’t want to spend weeks googling.

Want tools that auto-build market landscapes, “Top 50 buyers” lists, and valuation ranges.

🛠 Okapiq Features for Brokers

Proprietary Deal Radar

AI scans Yelp/Google for businesses with succession/digital gaps.

Ranks “likely to sell” SMBs in a metro.

Export → outreach list for broker prospecting.

Buyer Target Lists

Auto-generate PE firms, search funds, independent sponsors that have closed in a vertical.

Match by deal size, geography, EBITDA range.

Market Landscaping in a Click

TAM/TSM charts, HHI fragmentation score, demographic overlays.

One-click CIM pack → brokers can drop into decks.

Comparable Multiples Feed

Data Axle + broker-submitted comps + scraping of press releases.

“Plumbing businesses in TX have traded at 3.8x – 5.1x EBITDA in past 18mo.”

Broker Dashboard

Pipeline view: sellers on one side, matched buyers on the other.

“Smart Matching” → flags best buyer-seller fits.

🎯 Why This Wins Proprietary Deal Flow

Brokers love speed + credibility. If Okapiq makes their sell-side pitch sharper and their sourcing faster, they’ll push all their deals through you.

And since brokers sit between hundreds of sellers and buyers, they amplify distribution → every time a broker exports a CIM with Okapiq charts, we get more brand pull with buyers.

👉 Want me to add a “Broker Mode” into the architecture (so when ICP=Broker, they see Seller Prospecting + Buyer Lists + CIM Builder first), and I’ll sketch out the data model + endpoints for their pipeline?

You said:
what else canwe add think deeper
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 49s

Love it—let’s go beyond “lists + charts” and build broker-grade, proprietary-deal superpowers into Okapiq. Here’s a deeper, concrete plan plus plug-and-play code scaffolds you can drop into your backend.

What else to add (think deeper)
1) Proprietary Signal Graph (why this owner may sell)

Aggregate hard-to-fake signals into a ProprietaryScore with transparent “reason codes”:

Entity age & stability: SOS filing age, officer churn, address changes.

Succession risk: owner-age inference (public corp records / tenure), business age, % single-owner entities, “retire”, “moving”, “for sale” phrases in reviews/news.

Digital neglect: no site/SSL, broken pages, low GBP activity, slow response to reviews, <X photos, last post >12mo, ad starvation (no brand bidding).

Operational stress: job postings collapse, hiring freezes, opening-hour variability, frequent “temporary closed”.

Regulatory friction: licensing nearing expiry, new local rules (permits), UCC liens, OSHA citations (where public).

Demand/competitor shifts: review velocity ↓ YoY, category CPC ↑ with flat impressions, new big-box entrant in radius.

Concentration risk (from text): reviews mention 1–2 anchor clients; supplier dependence.

Local macro: rent spikes, commercial vacancy, demographic outflow, income shocks.

Infra & construction: street closures, zoning changes near location (ArcGIS layers).

Asset signals: domain expires soon, phone disconnected patterns, outdated NAP consistency.

Each signal → normalized 0–1 and logged with provenance so brokers can see the why in one click.

2) Broker Workflow (from “sniff” to mandate)

Proprietary Deal Radar: Returns targets + reason codes + suggested first outreach channel.

Instant Teaser Builder: Auto-redacts PII, watermarks, and comp tables; 1-click export to PDF/Deck.

Buyer Graph: Map acquirers by NAICS/geos/deals; rank “Likely Buyer Fit” for each seller.

Smart Sequencing: Channel mix by persona (call > email > mailer) based on your response model.

Mandate Pack: TAM/TSM + fragmentation + regulatory map + valuation range ready for pitch.

3) Models to learn & improve

Mandate Likelihood: Predicts broker-win probability on a target (train on past outreach outcomes).

Response Propensity: Optimizes channel/time-of-day cadence.

Valuation Prior: Calibrates multiples by micro-niche + geo over time (learned from closed comps).

Reason-to-Pitch: Picks the top 3 “why sell now” talking points per company.

4) UX that sells the story (and saves time)

Signal Cards: “Why this owner?” with ranked reasons + confidence badges.

Change Feed: “What changed this week?” (new violations, review drops, license expiring).

Geo Canvas: Tile layers (wealth, vacancy, permits) with click-through to targets.

Comparables Table: Anonymized comps, range sliders for quick sensitivity.

War Room: Pipeline Kanban (Lead → Contacted → Warm → Mandate → Live) with next-best-action.

5) Network effects & loops

CIM Builder → Watermark: Every exported teaser advertises Okapiq → more inbound buyers.

Data Co-op: Opt-in anonymized comps & outreach outcomes improve everyone’s models.

Broker–Buyer Matchmaking: Double-opt-in intros generate attribution and trust (and a fee path).

6) Compliance, trust, guardrails

Provenance panel for every metric (source + age).

Do-Not-Call / unsubscribe handling, role-based redaction, audit logs.

Ethical sourcing: only public/consented signals; opt-outs respected globally.

Extra ideas to truly out-compete

Seller Readiness Score: combines (a) data room hygiene (files present), (b) accounting system presence, (c) owner responsiveness, (d) legal clean-up flags → helps brokers prioritize mandates that will close.

“What changed?” Alerts: nightly deltas on your watchlist (license expired, domain dropped, lien filed, 3★ average slipped).

Route Planner (door-knock days): Build the shortest path to 15 high-propensity sellers; print postcards with unique QR/phone tracking.

Intern Taskboard (Scrappy Intel): push qualitative asks (“Call city clerk re: permit backlog”, “Price check 5 competitors”), auto-QA via checklists.

Buyer Heat: shows which buyers are opening teasers, sharing internally, and asking questions in VDR → real demand signal.

Anonymous Comp Co-op: members share bands (rev/EBITDA/multiple) under NDA → better priors; credits/discounts as incentives.

Post-close Intelligence: 100-day plan generator, vendor consolidation suggestions, price audit → makes Okapiq valuable after the deal too.

If you want, I can wire a Broker Mode preset (routes + weights + default dashboards) and drop it into your existing codebase so it’s selectable at signup, alongside the SFS/IS presets.

Perfect — let’s push this all the way into private equity (PE) level institutional intelligence. Right now we’ve built “Searcher + Broker Mode,” but for Okapiq to compete at PE-level, we need depth in data coverage, predictive analytics, valuation rigor, and portfolio ops support.

Here’s how we can level up:

🔥 Next-Level Functions (PE Tier)
1. Valuation Engine

Auto-Comps: Scrape closed deal data (PitchBook, CapitalIQ proxy, press releases, SOS filings) + anonymized co-op.

Dynamic Multiples: Adjusts EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue based on size, industry, growth, digital adoption, succession risk.

Comparable Clustering: Machine learning clusters similar firms → highlights valuation ranges + outliers.

Scenario Modeling: Sliders for growth rates, margin improvement, leverage levels → instant pro forma returns.

2. Return Modeling

LBO Model in the Cloud: Debt sizing (based on lender term sheets + benchmarks), exit multiple assumptions, sensitivity tables.

Monte Carlo Risk Engine: Simulate 1,000 scenarios on growth, margins, exit → show probability curve of returns.

Covenant Stress Tests: Warns if leverage/coverage too tight given historical volatility in industry.

3. Advanced Market Mapping

Supply Chain Graph: Map upstream suppliers + downstream customers for each target → identify choke points & roll-up synergies.

End Market Exposure: For each company → % revenue tied to construction, healthcare, consumer, gov. (via NLP on reviews/websites).

M&A Adjacencies: Algorithm suggests tangential verticals for bolt-ons.

4. Operational Benchmarking

Margin Benchmark: Compare company vs. industry medians (IRS SOI, BLS, private databases).

Labor Intensity: Ratio of employees to revenue vs. comps.

Tech Adoption Curve: Proxy by software spend, website stack, job postings (Greenhouse, Workday).

ESG/Regulatory Heatmap: OSHA violations, EPA citations, labor law disputes.

5. Sourcing Differentiators

“Silent Sellers”: Firms with quiet exit intent (succession + digital neglect + liens + real estate listing).

Founder LinkedIn Inactivity: CEO hasn’t posted/changed job title in 3+ years.

Tax/Legal Burdens: Property tax delinquency, lawsuits, liens.

6. Post-Close Playbook Generator

100-Day Plan Templates: Auto-builds ops plan: pricing optimization, vendor consolidation, digital modernization.

Synergy Estimator: For add-ons, quantifies cross-sell overlap + cost takeout potential.

Board Pack Builder: Auto quarterly pack → KPIs, TAM/TSM evolution, competitor news.

⚡ UX / Visualization (Investor-Grade)

Heatmap Layers: wealth + demand + competitor density + regulatory friction.

Comparable Valuation Scatterplots: EV/EBITDA vs. size → flagging where target sits.

Return Distribution Curve: Monte Carlo results → % likelihood of >20% IRR.

Supply Chain Graph: Interactive network diagram (nodes = suppliers/customers).

Succession/Digital Radar: Two-axis plot → aging owners vs. weak digital presence → “buy zone” quadrant.

🧠 AI/Algo Enhancements

Exit Timing Predictor: Predicts when a company might transact (succession + macro + credit cycle).

Multiple Expansion Predictor: Based on market trends + operational levers.

Smart Target Prioritization: Ranks 1,000+ companies into top 50 based on thesis fit, seller propensity, valuation gap.

🔗 Tech Architecture (PE Mode Add-ons)

Data Lake: Ingest financials, comps, job postings, sanctions data, UCC filings.

ML Pipelines: Train seller propensity & multiple expansion models.

Valuation Microservice: REST API returning comps + implied multiples.

Deal Model API: Input: EBITDA, debt terms → Output: IRR distribution, downside case.

Ops Benchmark API: Input: industry, size → Output: median margins, KPIs.

🛠️ Example Code Snippets
Valuation Engine – Comparable Ranges
def valuation_range(ebitda, industry, size, risk_factors):
    """
    Returns implied valuation multiples and EV range.
    """
    # Base multiples by industry
    base_multiple = {
        "Accounting": (5, 8),
        "Security": (4, 7),
        "Healthcare": (7, 12)
    }.get(industry, (5, 9))

    # Size premium
    if ebitda < 2_000_000:
        adj = -1
    elif ebitda > 10_000_000:
        adj = +1
    else:
        adj = 0

    # Risk adjustment (succession, digital neglect)
    risk_penalty = -0.5 * risk_factors.count("succession") - 0.5 * risk_factors.count("digital")

    low = (base_multiple[0] + adj + risk_penalty) * ebitda
    high = (base_multiple[1] + adj + risk_penalty) * ebitda
    return {"EV_low": low, "EV_high": high, "multiple_range": (base_multiple[0]+adj, base_multiple[1]+adj)}

Seller Propensity Score (with ML placeholder)
def seller_propensity(signals):
    """
    Score likelihood of sale based on multi-factor signals.
    """
    weights = {
        "succession_risk": 0.3,
        "digital_neglect": 0.2,
        "entity_age": 0.15,
        "review_decay": 0.15,
        "regulatory_risk": 0.1,
        "financial_stress": 0.1
    }
    score = sum(weights[s] * signals.get(s, 0) for s in weights)
    return round(score * 100, 1)  # 0–100 scale

Monte Carlo Return Simulation
import numpy as np

def monte_carlo_lbo(ebitda, purchase_multiple, exit_multiple, leverage, margin_growth, iterations=1000):
    results = []
    for _ in range(iterations):
        growth = np.random.normal(margin_growth, 0.02)
        exit_mult = np.random.normal(exit_multiple, 0.5)
        exit_val = ebitda * (1 + growth) * exit_mult
        entry_val = ebitda * purchase_multiple
        debt = entry_val * leverage
        equity = entry_val - debt
        irr = (exit_val - debt - equity) / equity
        results.append(irr)
    return np.percentile(results, [5, 25, 50, 75, 95])  # downside to upside


✅ With this stack, Okapiq stops being “just sourcing” and becomes a full-stack market intelligence & deal execution platform — bridging sourcing → underwriting → post-close playbooks.

Would you like me to mock up a PE-level IC Memo output (with TAM, TSM, valuation, succession risk, IRR distribution) so you can see how these new modules flow together?
